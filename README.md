Python Library - Turtle

Overview - Python's Turtle Graphics provides a physical illustration of a virtual "turtle" that draws on a screen, allowing for interactive, real-time visual feedback while learning programming concepts. It was made with education in mind, which makes it perfect for classroom instruction. It makes graphical output more accessible to programmers who require simple visualizations by streamlining it without adding extra library overhead. This user-friendly tool helps students understand the foundations of programming and opens the door to more complex graphical programming.

Starting a turtle environment - from turtle import *
(Please install the Tk interface package on your computer if you encounter the error "No module named '_tkinter'.")

basics.py 

import turtle as t
timmy_the_turtle = t.Turtle()
timmy_the_turtle.shape("turtle")
timmy_the_turtle.color("red")
timmy_the_turtle.forward(100)

explanation -  Basic turtle graphics methods include forward(), backward(), right(), left(), penup(), pendown(), speed(), color(), bgcolor(), and reset(). These commands control the turtle's movement, pen state, speed, and colors, enabling the creation of various shapes and patterns on the canvas.
